<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #888888;">Zoe - upon discussion with Peter Gibbings, the goal for these resources now includes providing a link to key contacts for the relevant area. So please take this into account in your design. I've been thinking that perhaps the links could be represented by: a web link symbol and an email symbol. I think, how I've done it here (scattered links per item) is quite messy visually. But I have high praises for your creativity, I know you will make it visually appealing <img class="emoticon emoticon-index-1" alt="smile" title="smile" src="http://mystaffdesk.usq.edu.au/moodle2/theme/image.php/usq2008vc/core/1409688906/s/smiley" /> I will call around tomorrow (21/8) to determine the email contacts for these resources. And update here accordingly.<br /></span></span></span></span></p>
